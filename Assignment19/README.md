# Blockchain Wallets

## Objective

The main objective of this assignment is to create a blockchain wallet and perform transactions. We will use Ethereum as the baseline technology.

## Requirements:

Given the need to create a Blockchain technology background we have used **GANACHE** as the way to create a Blockchain Wallet and perform transactions using it.

Moreover we have used **Streamlit** as the front end enviroment to run it all.

## Output

As per the below images you can see the transaction how it was performed on the front end (Streamlit) and then how it was executed on the back end (GANACHE).
